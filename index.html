				<h1>The Workshop of the Interplay between Digital Twins and 6G (VTC Fall 2024)</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>In conjunction with the 2024 IEEE 100th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2024-Fall)</h2>
				<h2>Oct 7-10, 2024</h2>

					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p>In the rapidly evolving technological landscape, digital twins (DT) and 6G fields have become increasingly intertwined. A DT is a virtual replica of a physical object, process, or system that can be used for various purposes, such as simulation, monitoring, analysis, and control. Therefore, 6G can benefit from the DT in terms of network optimization, maintenance based on prediction, security enhancement, real-time monitoring, and management. Meanwhile, 6G empowers DT by environment sensing, data transmission, computing offloading, etc. This workshop aims to explore the mutual benefit between these two areas, focusing on how advancements in DT technologies have propelled the growth of 6G and vice versa. This research field is relatively new and has not been well understood, and therefore, this workshop is expected to bring together and disseminate state-of-the-art research contributions that promote the research in this field and gather contributions from industry and academia on the DT-empowered 6G and 6G-enhanced DT. Participants will gain insight into the foundational principles, current trends, and future directions of DT and wireless communications, fostering a comprehensive understanding of their interplay and implications for various industries. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
